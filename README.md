Using the published database of Adventure Works in 2016-2019, I designed an interactive, insightful dashboard using Power BI and DAX which indicates statistical metrics, such as total profit, total margin, budget variance, and the ratio of annual sales growth to the last year for the selected year, and insightful findings such as how the total sales of a subcategory change in a 30-day interval, how purchase intentions of individuals change by living country, occupation category, and gender type, and so forth.

# About Dataset:
You can download the database from this [link](https://github.com/amirho3einsedaghati/Adventure-Works-Dashboard/blob/main/dataset/Adventure%20Works%202020.xlsx).

# About Reports
The dashboard has three reports, one main tab, and two tooltip tabs.

<ul>
<li>how total sales, total cost, total budget, total profit, total margin, budget variance, and the ratio of annual sales growth change by year.</li>
<li>the effect of selecting an available year on a graph shows the relation between the annual sales growth and the selected year's total sales for different subcategories.</li>
<li>how selecting an available year can change total sales and the ratio of annual sales growth to the last year by subcategory in different countries.</li>
<li>how purchase intentions of individuals change by living country, occupation category, and gender type in different situations for example when we are in a specific year, month, and interval.</li>
</ul>
